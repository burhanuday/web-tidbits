# WEB TIDBITS
This is something i do for fun. All these tidbits are pure html and css and can be used very easily in your own projects.
## Usage
To see these bits, go to

This repository contains the source codes to all the tidbits that i have either made myself or are inspired from something i saw somewhere.
